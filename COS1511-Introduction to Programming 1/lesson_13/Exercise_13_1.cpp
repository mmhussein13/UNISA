/*
Your child wants to go to university and you must consider all the options. 
You state the case as follows to her: If she obtains 90% of higher, she can go to 
any university of her choice and you will give her a car. If she obtains from 75% 
to 89%, and she earns more than R5 000 during the December holidays, she can also 
go the university of her choice and you will give her a car. If she obtains more 
than 74% but does not earn enough money, she can study at the university of her 
choice, but you will not give her a car. If she obtains less than 75%, but more 
than 59%, she must study at the nearest university. With less than 60% she cannot 
go to university and will have to consider other alternatives.
Write a program to read in your daughterâ€™s average mark, and the amount that she 
earned in her holiday job, and display a message indicating which university she 
may attend.
The program must use a switch statement.
